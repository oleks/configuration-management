** Exercises

1. Write a shell-script- to clone [[https://github.com/DIKU-EDU/kudos]] if no
  =kudos= direcctory exists in the working directory, and to fetch and checkout
  the =master= branch if the directory already exists.

  This lets you avoid cloning the git repository every time, while also letting
  you stay up to date with changes in =master=. This script is not well-suited
  for humans working with git, but could be useful for various bots.

2. Modify the shell-script to checkout a user-specified (specified via a
  command-line argument) branch, tag, or commit. Let the script default to
  checking out =master=.
