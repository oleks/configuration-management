** Exercises

1. Write a shell-script- to clone [[https://github.com/DIKU-EDU/kudos]] if no
  =kudos= direcctory exists in the working directory, and to fetch and checkout
  the =master= branch if the directory already exists.

  This enables you to not resort to cloning a git repository anew if no changes
  have been made, but makes sure you are always using the most recent =master=
  for your needs.

2. Modify the shell-script to checkout a user-specified (specified via a
  command-line argument) branch, tag, or commit. Let the script default to
  checking out =master=.
